"""Displacement-minimizing legalization: triage and order-preserving local spreading.

:func:`pnr.place.legalize.legalize` uses this (``PNR_LEGALIZE_KEEP``, on by default;
:mod:`pnr.legalize_flags`) before its slot packer, on boxes it builds from the global placement
(GP): each movable part's slot (its courtyard grown as the legalizer grows it, rounded up to the
slot grid) at its GP pose, and the obstacles (fixed parts, keep-outs, parts the spreading may not
push, the outline).

1. :func:`triage` sorts the movable parts by how badly they conflict at their GP poses. A part's
   *occlusion* is the fraction of its slot covered by other slots, obstacles or the space outside
   the outline. While some part has an occlusion of at least :data:`SEVERE` (half its slot or
   more), the worst one (ties: one free to take either side, then the smaller, then the later
   reference) is *severe*: it leaves the GP
   layout, and the occlusions of the rest are taken again without it. What is left is *clean*
   (occlusion 0: legal where it is) or *mild* (a small overlap).
2. :func:`spread` resolves the mild overlaps by pushing parts apart along one axis per pair
   (horizontal and vertical constraint graphs taken from the GP poses): a pair that overlaps is
   separated along the axis of its smaller penetration, in its GP order; a pair already side by
   side keeps its order on that axis. The new centres are the weighted least-squares projection
   of the GP centres (weight: slot area, so a small part gives way to a big one) onto those
   constraints and each slot's bounds (the outline and the obstacles it faces), computed per axis
   by Dykstra's alternating projections. Pairs that come to overlap get a constraint on the axis
   they were apart on at GP, and the solve repeats (:data:`ROUNDS`). Where the legalizer's
   routing-channel model asks for an escape channel between two facing pad rows, the pair's
   distance includes it (the channel is part of the clearance the parts need), so a push opens
   the channels the packer's channel cost would have opened, and a part short of one at its GP
   pose is pushed like a mild overlap. A part pushed further than its cascade bound
   (:func:`reach`), or a solve that cannot meet its constraints, fails the spreading of its
   cluster; the caller then makes the most occluded mild part of that cluster
   severe and spreads again.

The legalizer then takes, for every part that is not severe, the slot nearest its (spread) pose
within a grid snap and keeps its GP turn, and only when no such slot is free does the part fall
back to the packer's full search; the severe parts are relocated last by the packer's own cost
(displacement, routing channels, wirelength) and turn search.
