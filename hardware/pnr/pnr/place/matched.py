"""Matched lengths after legalization: keep the legs of each pair and group even.

Global placement pulls the members of every declared differential pair and
length-match group toward equal estimated lengths (:func:`pnr.place.model.length_mismatch`),
but the legalizer then packs each part into the free slot nearest its target, so
two series resistors that sat side by side can end up at different distances from
the connector and the MCU. A meander adds only what fits beside the route; a leg
10-20 mm longer than its partner is out of reach. :func:`refine_matched` moves the
small parts on the matched nets (at most :data:`MAX_PADS` pads, not fixed or held by
another hard constraint) to the legal slot that best evens the estimated lengths, at
a price for the move and for the wirelength it adds, and keeps the legalized
placement whenever that would add a hard violation. A design without pairs or
groups never gets here.

The estimate is the 45-degree routing distance (octile) between the two pins of a
two-pin net, and the half perimeter of a larger net's pins.

PNR_COMPACT (:mod:`pnr.place.compact`, default off): a moved part with an offset
courtyard takes the slot of its body box (pose = slot centre less its shift), and
``margins`` grows every slot by the parts' copper margins, as in the legalizer.
