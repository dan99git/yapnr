"""Legalization motion: how far legalization moves parts from their global-placement poses.

Global placement (:mod:`pnr.place.model`) leaves a continuous layout whose relative order (who
sits left of, above, next to whom) carries most of its wirelength structure; the legalizer
should keep that and move only what conflicts. This module measures it (stdlib only, besides
the placement geometry):

- :func:`slot_rect`: a part's reserved slot, as the legalizer sizes it (courtyard times its
  inflation, plus the clearance and twice its copper margin), at any pose;
- :func:`occlusion`: per part, the fraction of its slot covered by other slots, by fixed parts
  and keep-outs, or lying outside the outline (0: legal where it is; 1: fully occluded);
- :func:`motion`: per part, the displacement and rotation change from one pose set to
  another, the moved count, and the topology kept (the fraction of pairwise left/right and
  above/below relations of the first pose set that the second keeps).

:func:`pnr.place.legalize.legalize` records :func:`motion` of each call as its ``motion``
(the placement report, the trace's ``legal`` event and the run results carry it).
