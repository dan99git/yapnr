"""Legalization — snap a continuous placement to a non-overlapping one.

Global placement (:mod:`pnr.place.model`) gives good continuous positions but
with residual courtyard overlaps. This turns that into a strictly legal layout:
every movable part is snapped to a grid-aligned slot whose block is disjoint from
all others, from the fixed parts, from the keep-outs, and from the outline
border — so the result has **0 overlaps and is fully in-outline** by construction.

Algorithm (a nearest-free-fit shelf/grid packer): rasterize the outline at a fine
grid, mark fixed courtyards + keep-outs occupied, then place movable parts
biggest-first, each into the free block nearest its continuous target. Because
each part's block is ``ceil((size + clearance)/g)`` cells, disjoint blocks keep
courtyards at least ``clearance`` apart. Placing biggest-first avoids stranding
large parts once the board fills; the nearest-to-target rule preserves the
wirelength structure the global stage found.

PNR_PAIR_LANDING_RESERVE=1 (src13, default off; only when some component carries
pair_landing reserves): legalization keeps two more rasters per side (bodies
mounted there, landing reserves) so no part body is snapped onto a reserve of its
mount side and no terminal part is snapped where its own reserve lies under an
opposite-side body; refine_channels rejects moves that would do the same.

PNR_COMPACT (:mod:`pnr.place.compact`, default off): a part with an offset courtyard
(``COURTYARD``, :func:`pnr.place.geometry.body_shift`) takes the slot of its body box, so
the slot centre is ``pos + shift``: :func:`_place_part` compares the candidate centres
less the shift (``pos`` space) with the target, the hard group discs, the edge box and
the candidate cost, and every pose is set to the slot centre less the shift. ``margins``
(``LEGALIZE``) grows a part's slot by a copper margin on every side. Without either,
every slot and pose is computed exactly as before.

PNR_LEGALIZE_HPWL=<w> (:mod:`pnr.legalize_flags`, default off; the placer passes it as
``wire_weight``): every candidate slot also costs ``w`` times the part's wirelength there
(:func:`wire_cost`, plane nets left out), and the slot is chosen together with the turn: the
search runs once per quarter turn (:func:`wire_turns`, the global turn first) and keeps the
cheapest outcome. Parts on a matched-length net (``wire_exempt``) keep the plain search. With
``wire_weight`` 0 (the default) the cost and the turn search are exactly as before.

    """Return a copy of ``graph`` with movable parts snapped to a legal layout.

    ``fixed`` maps refs to their held centres (placed as-is, marked as obstacles);
    ``keepouts`` are blocked regions. Movable parts are read at their current
    (continuous) ``pos`` as the placement target. ``inflation`` optionally scales
    the *reserved* footprint of a part (RePlAce cell inflation, §6): a factor > 1
    grows the slot a congested part claims so the packer spreads it into lower-
    density space — the part's real courtyard (used for the legality check) is
    unchanged. ``spread`` is a *floor* on that factor applied to **every** movable
    part, so legalization leaves routing channels between all footprints (HPWL
    global placement otherwise packs parts shoulder-to-shoulder with no room for
    tracks). ``group_limits`` intersects centre-distance discs (anchor x/y,
    radius) for each constrained part. Raises :class:`LegalizationError` if a
    part cannot fit without violating one of those discs.

    ``channel_model`` adds directional pad-escape demand to candidate costs.
    This is a soft routing estimate, not an additional legality guarantee.

    ``roles`` (power-first placement, :mod:`pnr.place.power_first`; inert when
    None) orders parts by tier inside the parent-first/hard-block order, moves
    each target by the weighted displacement of already placed cost neighbours,
    and accepts a slot only if a greedy trial pack of every unplaced
    hard-limited part still succeeds (ban and retry, then normal backtracking).

    ``pad_edge`` ((copper, hole) mm, :func:`pad_edge_rule`; None = off) keeps
    every movable part's pads and drills that far from the outline, not only its
    courtyard ``clearance / 2`` inside it.

    ``edge_bands`` ({ref: (edge, tolerance mm)}, hard ``edge_align``; None = off)
    keeps each listed part's courtyard within the tolerance of its edge: its slot
    centre is bounded like ``pad_edge`` does, per tried rotation, and its spreading
    factor is capped so the reserved slot still fits the band.

    ``side_options`` ({ref: allowed sides}, :func:`pnr.place.sides.plan`; None = off)
    lets a part with two options take the slot nearest its target on either side:
    when its current side has no slot, or only one more than ``side_retry_mm`` from
    its target, the other side is tried too and the cheaper slot wins, its cost the
    slot cost (squared displacement plus channel demand) plus ``side_weight`` (mm)
    times ``side_cost(graph)`` (mm, :func:`pnr.place.sides.side_cost` of the board
    with that choice). A part with one option keeps its side.

    ``stack`` (refs, :func:`pnr.place.sides.stack_refs`; None = off) adds a ``stack``
    occupancy plane that each of those parts tests and marks whatever its side, so two
    of them never overlap back to back on opposite sides.

    ``regions`` / ``aligns`` (the ``region`` / ``align`` constraints,
    :func:`legalize_constraint_kwargs`; None = off): a hard region bounds the slot
    centre per tried rotation (a rectangle as a box, a polygon or union as a raster
    mask), a hard align bounds it to the band the members already placed leave
    (``tol_mm``), and each aligned member's target moves onto the line. Soft ones add
    their penalty to the candidate cost. Aligned members are ordered as one block,
    and a slot that strands a later member is backtracked like a hard group's.

    ``outline`` (``legalize: {outline: exact}``, :mod:`pnr.place.legal_options`; None =
    the raster alone) bounds every slot centre so the part's courtyard stays inside the
    ``width x height`` outline by the hard check's own test, which the raster's partial
    last row and column do not.

    ``order`` (``legalize: {order: scarcity}``; None = blocks first) makes every part
    held by a hard region or edge band and in no block a block of its own, so it is
    ordered with the hard-group blocks by remaining slots per area instead of after all
    of them, and goes ahead of the active block once it has fewer free slots left than
    every part of that block. ``lookahead`` (``legalize: {lookahead: regions}``; None = off) refuses a
    slot that strands an unplaced part held by a hard group, region or edge band with
    few slots left (:func:`starves` without power-first; the nearest slot is kept when
    every tried one strands).

    ``pad_group_edges`` ([(anchor, pad, member, radius)], hard groups with
    ``anchor_pad``, :func:`pnr.place.legal_options.hard_pad_group_edges`; None = none)
    bounds each member's centre to the radius about the placed anchor's pad (the anchor
    is placed first) and orders the group as one block, like ``group_edges``.

    With hull macros (``PNR_MACRO_HULL=1``) the occupancy gains an ``inner`` plane:
    hull macros mark their inner-layer mask there, drilled parts and solid block
    macros their whole slot, so a hole never lands on block inner copper and two
    blocks' inner copper never meet.

    ``margins`` ({ref: mm}, PNR_COMPACT ``LEGALIZE``: :func:`pnr.place.compact.margins`;
    None = off) grows each listed part's slot, and a fixed part's marked area, by that
    copper margin on every side. A part with an offset courtyard (PNR_COMPACT
    ``COURTYARD``) takes the slot of its body box and keeps ``pos`` its origin.

    ``wire_weight`` (mm² per mm, ``PNR_LEGALIZE_HPWL`` as :func:`pnr.place.placer.place`
    passes it; None or 0 = off) adds ``wire_weight * wire_cost`` to every candidate's cost and to
    :func:`slot_cost`, and a part free to turn (``allow_rotation``, no hard rotation) has its
    slot searched at each of its four quarter turns, global turn first: the cheapest outcome
    wins, a tie keeps the earlier turn, and under ``lookahead: regions`` a turn whose every slot
    strands a part counts only when every turn does. Line and block macros turn as one body;
    the side retry compares the two sides' best turns; a backtracking ban covers the banned
    slot's half turn as well. ``wire_exempt`` (refs) keeps the plain search for those parts
    (the placer passes the parts on a diff-pair or length-match net:
    :func:`pnr.place.reorient.matched_refs`).

    ``keep`` (``PNR_LEGALIZE_KEEP``, :func:`pnr.legalize_flags.legalize_keep` when None; on by
    default, off under power-first placement): displacement-minimizing legalization
    (:mod:`pnr.place.keep`). Before the packer runs, the movable parts are triaged at their
    global poses: a part whose slot is half or more occluded (by other slots, fixed parts,
    keep-outs or the outside of the outline) is *severe*, the rest clean or mild; the mild
    overlaps are resolved by an order-preserving push of the parts around them (a bounded
    cascade), and a cluster the push cannot resolve gives up its most occluded part to the severe
    ones. Every part that is not severe is then placed first, biggest first, in the free slot
    nearest its (pushed) pose within :data:`KEEP_SNAP_CELLS` grid cells, at its global turn and
    without the channel or wirelength terms; only when no such slot is free does it take the
    packer's full search like the severe parts, which come last. The held parts (hard groups,
    aligns, regions, edge bands, hard discs) are placed before any free part is held, each at its
    global pose when that slot is free. Should that leave a part without a slot, the whole board
    is legalized again with ``keep`` off (``keep_fallback`` in the record). The returned graph
    carries the motion record as ``legal_motion`` (:func:`pnr.place.motion.motion` from the
    global poses, plus the triage counts).
