"""Compact placement (``PNR_COMPACT``) and shrink-to-fit (``PNR_SHRINK``), default off.

Design: docs/design/compact-placement.md. The switches are read by :mod:`pnr.compact_flags`
(stdlib only); every call site guards on them, so with the flags unset the engine takes
exactly its previous paths and writes no new keys into its JSON. This module is stdlib-only.

Parts of ``PNR_COMPACT=1`` (``PNR_COMPACT_<PART>=0`` drops one):

``GP``
    Global placement at spread 1.0 (:func:`spread`, overriding the ladder's board-filling
    1.3) in the placer, the initial pool and the place-route loop; the random starts of
    the global stage and the initial pool are drawn in a cluster box (:func:`cluster_box`)
    around the fixed parts instead of the whole board. Space then grows only where the
    router measured congestion (:func:`pnr.route.feedback.derive_inflation`, unchanged).
``RANK``
    A compactness tie-break in the Monte Carlo selections, always after every completion
    key (:func:`metrics`; the orders are listed there).
``LEGALIZE``
    Legalizer settings from :func:`legalize_settings`: the courtyard gap (authored
    ``board.courtyard_clearance_mm``, else :data:`GAP_MM`) instead of the routing
    clearance, a per-part copper margin, a :data:`GRID_MM` slot grid and the fab edge
    rules for pads and drills. Copper clearance stays with the router and native DRC.
``COURTYARD``
    Offset courtyards: a part occupies its ingested body box (``Component.body``: the
    courtyard, or the body, united with the pads and silk, as it lies about the origin),
    turned with the part (:func:`pnr.place.geometry.courtyard_rect`,
    :func:`pnr.place.geometry.body_shift`); ``pos`` stays the footprint origin.
``DROPS``
    A ``plane_layer`` net without a declared stack gets its plane drops from the detailed
    router, planned with the signal escapes (:func:`pnr.route.detail.router.route_board`),
    instead of writeback's dog-bones after routing.

``PNR_SHRINK=1`` (:func:`shrink_search`, flat driver only) treats the outline as an
envelope and keeps the smallest probed outline whose place-route loop converges.

    """Up to ``probes`` outline scales in ``[lower, 1)``, in a fixed order: ``first`` (the
    envelope run's bounding box, when given and above ``lower``), then bisection between
    the largest failed scale (``lower`` at first) and the smallest converged one (1.0, the

    ``probe(w, h)`` runs one complete place-route loop on that outline and returns

    converged size and its result (None, None when no probe converged) and the probe
    records, in probe order. Sizes are rounded to :data:`SHRINK_ROUND_MM`; the search
    stops when the rounded size repeats or reaches the envelope."""
