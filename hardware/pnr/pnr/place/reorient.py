"""In-place quarter turns after legalization (``PNR_LEGALIZE_REORIENT=1``, default off).

Design: docs/design/compact-placement.md section 11 (``C2``). The legalizer keeps the global
placer's turn (or, with ``PNR_LEGALIZE_HPWL``, chooses it with the slot); once every part is
placed, a turn that was right for the global target can be wrong at the legal pose. This pass
turns parts about their slot centre (the centre of the occupied box, which is where the
legalizer centred the slot) where that shortens their wirelength:

- greedy, best gain first: each round evaluates every candidate part at its three other turns
  and takes the single turn with the largest wirelength gain, ties broken by the reference and
  then the turn; to a fixed point, with at most four times as many turns in all as there are
  candidates (every accepted turn strictly shortens the total wirelength, so the cap only
  bounds the work);
- a turn is taken only if the part's half-perimeter wirelength (plane nets left out, as the
  legalizer's term, :func:`pnr.place.legalize.wire_cost`) drops by more than :data:`GAIN_MM`,
  it is legal in place (:func:`pnr.place.metrics.pose_checker` with the legalizer's clearance,
  spreading factor or inflation, copper margins and pad-edge rule: hard rotation and side,
  outline, keep-outs, regions, aligns, edge bands, group radii and every other part), and its
  routing-channel penalty against all other parts (:class:`pnr.place.channels.ChannelModel`)
  does not rise (the channel guard; ``channel_guard=False``, ``PNR_LEGALIZE_REORIENT=wire``,
  drops it: wirelength and legality only);
- never turned: fixed and locked parts, hard rotations, row and line-group members, macros
  (``block:``, ``line:``) and the parts on a differential pair or length-match net (the
  matched-length pass evened them).

Ties keep the turn: a two-pad part whose nets both leave on one side has the same wirelength in
every correctly polarised turn, so this pass alone does not make such a part "flush" with a row;
the legalizer's wirelength term (``PNR_LEGALIZE_HPWL``) does, by choosing the slot and turn
together. Deterministic: no random draws, fixed orders, float64 arithmetic.
