"""Placement orchestrator: global placement → legalization → report.

PNR_PAIR_LANDING_RESERVE=1 (src13, default off): place() attaches the diff-pair
via landing reserves of pnr.place.pair_landing (from ``channel_rules``) before
legalization; legality/report then include them through placement_rects.

PNR_COMPACT=1 (default off; :mod:`pnr.place.compact`, docs/design/compact-placement.md):
spread 1.0 and starts drawn in a cluster box (``GP``), the compact legalizer settings
(``LEGALIZE``: courtyard gap, copper margins, 0.125 mm slots, pads off the outline) and
offset courtyards (``COURTYARD``) wherever a part has an off-centre body.

Legalizer and global-placement switches (:mod:`pnr.legalize_flags`, default off, with or
without PNR_COMPACT; docs/design/compact-placement.md section 11): ``PNR_GP_POLISH`` /
``PNR_GP_CHANNELS`` end global placement with a phase on the legalizer's slots (and its
channel cost, :mod:`pnr.place.gp_polish`), ``PNR_LEGALIZE_HPWL`` gives the legalizer a
wirelength term and the choice of all four turns, and ``PNR_LEGALIZE_REORIENT`` turns parts in
place after legalization (:mod:`pnr.place.reorient`).

    ``hpwl_baseline`` is the wirelength of the incoming (atopile row) placement,
    so the report shows the improvement. With ``orient`` the placer also picks a
    90° rotation per movable part (Phase 3). ``inflation`` (ref → spreading
    multiplier) is the routing-feedback hook (§6): the place↔route loop grows the
    footprint of congested parts so the next round spreads them.
    ``pair_weights`` ({(ref_a, pad_a, ref_b, pad_b): w}) adds a pad-pair
    attraction ``w * |pad_a - pad_b|`` to the global objective (pnr.feedback:
    connections that often fail routing); None leaves the objective untouched.
    Deterministic under a fixed ``seed`` on one platform (OS, architecture and
    torch build); another platform gives a different placement of the same
    quality on average (pnr.place.model).

    Sides (:mod:`pnr.place.sides`): on a double-sided board (``board.sides: double``)
    a held part is put on its one side first (an ``edge_align`` side), global
    placement relaxes the side of every free part too (starting toward
    ``initial_sides``, {ref: side}), the legalizer may take the slot on its other side,
    and a detail pass (:mod:`pnr.place.detail_moves`) tries flips and pairwise swaps; a
    held part never changes side (checked), and two parts that fan out never stack back
    to back (:func:`pnr.place.sides.stack_refs`). With nothing free the flow is the
    single-sided one, as it is under power-first placement (``PNR_POWER_FIRST=1``),
    which keeps every side.

    PNR_COMPACT=1 (:mod:`pnr.place.compact`): the spread floor is 1.0 and the global
    starts are drawn in a cluster box (``GP``), the legalizer keeps the courtyard gap,
    copper margins and a finer grid (``LEGALIZE``), and offset courtyards hold their body
    box (``COURTYARD``). Under power-first placement every part but ``WIRE`` and ``TURN``
