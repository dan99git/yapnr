"""Divide one dedicated plane layer among several supply rails (``plane_partition``).

Where several nets share a power layer, :func:`pnr.stack.plane_regions` gives every
net but the one with most pads its pads' bounding box plus 2 mm: boxes of rails
whose balls spread over the same package overlap, and the smaller box wins. A
partition instead gives each rail a **connected territory** built from its own
terminals:

1. the layer is rasterized at ``h_mm`` (0.1 mm) inside the outline less the edge
   clearance; foreign through copper is blocked with its clearance (other nets'
   planned vias, fixed vias, plated holes, mounting holes), and so are keepouts
   that bar pours on the layer (except for the nets they allow);
2. a rail's terminals are its planned drop vias (the fanout's, fixed ones: their
   lands) and, for a surface pad without one yet, the disc within
   ``terminal_reach_mm`` of the pad where the drop planner puts its via;
3. rails are taken in order (peak current, then terminal count, then name; or as
   listed); each gets a Steiner tree over its terminals (shortest-path heuristic:
   Dijkstra from the tree to the nearest remaining terminal; a cell costs more where
   the trunk would be narrower than it should be, and inside another rail's
   terminal disc), claimed with its width ``w`` = the largest of ``min_width_mm``,
   the IPC-2221 internal width for the rail's current, and ``R_sq L / R_share``
   for its IR budget (``L`` the root's path to its farthest terminal, ``R_share``
   the budget less two via barrels, at least a quarter of it; at most 10 mm),
   keeping ``split_gap_mm`` of copper from every other rail. ``min_width_mm`` is a
   hard limit: the tree passes only where a zone that wide fits, except inside the
   rail's own terminal discs (and within ``neck_mm``, default 0, of them). A
   terminal no such tree reaches is joined where a zone of the board's minimum
   width (the fab track width writeback gives the zones) still fills, and reported
   **necked** with the narrowest copper on its way (step 6). Foreign copper keeps
   the larger class clearance of the pair, as KiCad's fill does;
4. a terminal no path reaches at all is reported unreached (the pad's drop then
   fails in the drop planner, as a pad outside its region does);
5. the territories grow into the free cells round the board (a breadth-first
   competition), and grown copper is carved back to keep the split gap;
6. each territory becomes polygons (cell boundaries, holes kept where another rail
   or free copper sits in them), checked for one connected piece per rail, for
   the narrowest width along its trunk, and per terminal for the widest way to the
   root (the largest, over all paths in the drawn copper, of the narrowest copper
   along the path, the terminal discs exempt): a terminal behind copper narrower
   than ``min_width_mm`` is **necked** (reported with the neck's width and place,
   a failure site of the route, and a warning), as is a trunk narrower than its
   IPC-2221 width (``ipc_neck``). ``fill`` takes what is left (a zone of that net
   over the whole outline at priority 0, under the rails);
7. with ``core_no_vias`` other nets' vias may not land on a trunk's claimed copper
   (its width ``w`` about the centre line, where the trunk could take it: the
   router's net keepouts), so a row of vias cannot cut a rail's trunk.

The result is cached by the digest of its inputs. :func:`for_route` gathers the
inputs on the detailed router's grid; :class:`Partition` gives the regions
(:class:`pnr.stack.Region`, which :class:`pnr.stack.PlaneAccess` and the writeback
use) and the report. numpy only.
