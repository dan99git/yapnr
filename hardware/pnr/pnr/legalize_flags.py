"""Legalizer and global-placement polish switches (stdlib only; docs/design/compact-placement.md
section 11, "Spacing and turns at legalization").

The logic lives in :mod:`pnr.place.gp_polish` (global placement), :func:`pnr.place.legalize.legalize`
and :mod:`pnr.place.reorient`; this module only reads the environment, so stdlib-only modules
ask the same question as the placer without importing torch or numpy. Every switch is off by
default and works with or without ``PNR_COMPACT``:

``PNR_GP_POLISH=1``
    A final global-placement phase (:data:`POLISH_STEPS` more iterations of
    :func:`pnr.place.model.global_place`'s loop) with the turns and sides frozen, whose overlap
    term uses the legalizer's own slot (courtyard grown by the spreading factor, the clearance and
    the copper margin, rounded up to the slot grid), so snapping cannot create overlaps.
``PNR_GP_CHANNELS=<lambda>``
    The polish (implied) also carries the legalizer's routing-channel cost, made smooth:
    ``lambda * sum shortage^2`` over facing pad rows (:class:`pnr.place.channels.ChannelModel`).
``PNR_POOL_SOURCE_CLAMP=1``
    The initial pool's source start (``start-01``) clamps every movable source position into the
    outline (the cluster box under ``PNR_COMPACT`` ``GP``) before global placement.
``PNR_LEGALIZE_HPWL=<w>``
    The legalizer's slot cost gains ``w`` times the part's wirelength (half-perimeter, plane nets
    left out), and the slot is chosen together with the turn among all four quarter turns.
``PNR_LEGALIZE_REORIENT=1``
    After legalization (and the align snap and the matched-length pass), a greedy in-place pass
    turns parts about their slot centre where that shortens their wirelength, stays legal and does
    not raise the part's routing-channel penalty. ``PNR_LEGALIZE_REORIENT=wire`` drops the channel
    guard (wirelength and legality only, the prototype's rule), for the A/B. Only where the
    placer may turn parts (``orient``).
``PNR_LEGALIZE_CHANNEL_CLEARANCE=fab``
    The legalizer's routing-channel model (:class:`pnr.place.channels.ChannelModel`) spaces the
    tracks of nets without a class at the fab clearance (``fab.clearance_mm``, the router's)
    instead of the board's ``default_clearance_mm``.
``PNR_LINE_SATELLITES=1``
    A line group (:mod:`pnr.place.line_group`) carries its members' satellites: a free two-pad
    part joined to one member pad by a two-pin net sits flush beside that member, in line with
    it, as part of the rigid line (:func:`pnr.place.line_group.satellites`).

Unset (or ``0``), every caller takes its unchanged path and writes no new JSON keys.

One switch is on by default and turns off with ``0`` (for A/B runs):

``PNR_LEGALIZE_KEEP``
    Displacement-minimizing legalization (:mod:`pnr.place.keep`): a part legal at its
    global-placement pose keeps it (a grid snap) and its turn, a slightly overlapping one and its
    neighbours are pushed apart in their global order, and only a mostly occluded part (or one
    the push cannot fit) is relocated by the packer's cost and turn search; with
    ``PNR_LEGALIZE_REORIENT`` (or ``TURN``) only the parts the legalizer moved turn afterwards.
    ``0`` restores the plain nearest-free-slot packer for every part.

Under ``PNR_COMPACT=1`` three of them are compact parts (:mod:`pnr.compact_flags`): ``WIRE``
(``PNR_LEGALIZE_HPWL`` at :data:`COMPACT_WIRE_WEIGHT`), ``TURN`` (``PNR_LEGALIZE_REORIENT=wire``)
and ``SATELLITES`` (``PNR_LINE_SATELLITES=1``). A variable that is set, ``0`` included, wins over
its part; ``PNR_COMPACT_<PART>=0`` drops the part.
